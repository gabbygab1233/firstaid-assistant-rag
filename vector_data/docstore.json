assistance given to someone who is ill or injured. In the\n vital few minutes before the emergency services arrive basic first aid can be the\n difference between life and death.\n The five most common causes of needless death from a lack of first aid are:\n- choking\n- the heart not beating\n- severe bleeding\n- heart attack\n- blocked airway.\n This reference guide provides information about how to respond to each of these\n emergency situations. It also contains guidance about how to deal with many other\n injuries and conditions that you may encounter in your daily life. As well as specific\n treatments, you will also learn how to manage a first aid incident as a whole.\n The essential advice and practical information contained here will help you to act in\n an effective, safe and prompt way, ensuring that, should an emergency occur, you\n can be the difference between a life lost and a life saved.\n The first aider\n Anyone can be a first aider. The skills are not difficult to learn, and their value\n cannot be overestimated. Whether you are busy shopping, looking after children,\n playing sport, out and about, or providing first aid as a volunteer or as part of your\n job, it is likely that at some point you will encounter someone who needs first aid.\n As a first aider, you may be:\n- working in a small organisation\n- a childminder\n- providing first aid in a public place\n- the first at the scene of a car crash\n- one of several first aiders in a large company\n- a teacher.\n If you are providing first aid at work or as a volunteer, it is important that you\n receive appropriate training so you have the knowledge and skills for your role. This\n reference guide aims to support your first aid training, giving you all the notes and\n guidance you need in one place.\n First aid training is not a one-off process. It requires ongoing practice and regular\n refresher training to ensure your knowledge and skills are kept up to date.\n\n First aid reference guide 5\nAs well as receiving first aid training, it is vital that your role is supported by clear\npolicies and procedures. Whether you are a hotel receptionist or a graphic designer,\nit is important that you understand how the first aid role works in your setting.\nThe information in this guide is set out so you can:\n- take an overview of the role of the first aider\n- deal with a first aid incident\n- treat specific injuries\n- manage common medical conditions\n- know what first aid equipment may be needed for your role\n- understand how the setting can affect first aid needs.\nGeneral information on COVID-19 or pandemics\nDuring a pandemic (such as COVID-19) it is important that you keep yourself safe.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3889, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb266c79-3e30-4d21-8ca8-c6f98ba49cd6": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb266c79-3e30-4d21-8ca8-c6f98ba49cd6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef416662-5c4f-4e4d-a64e-9d47b2c652c0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f2db8fb812d31f2a5429fc5d31448ecb4071fcd386825661d9cb9ae69fa5efe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6f22c3af-17fe-4643-9817-f23cc06b620f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6dd925ed9e42fef35d969bacfd0128fda825450c39f8b1239291564ac07ce84f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "264357a1-1ef9-4ece-bf64-668bcd6076ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "28b5651407443bdf1e6febd75ad5b5d6a08618a0d197e600c491f9384e66bfb8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "First aid training is not a one-off process.

It is a diverse\n role that requires the skills and knowledge to provide effective, safe and prompt\n first aid, as well as the ability to work and communicate effectively with a variety of\n people.\n An effective first aider\n As a first aider you should:\n- be calm in your approach\n- be aware of risks to yourself and others\n- build and maintain trust with all those involved in an incident\n- give early treatment\n- call for appropriate help\n- remember your own needs.\n All the skills you need to be an effective first aider are covered on your training\n course.\n Health and safety and first aid\n Much is made of the health and safety culture - most of it negative. However, health\n and safety is simply a common-sense approach to minimising the risk of harm or\n injury. It uses a methodical and logical procedure to do this which allows you to put\n in place appropriate measures to manage an incident, for instance, training first\n aiders and providing them with the appropriate equipment.\n Health and safety requirements come from:\n- legislation\n- best practice\n- the organisation's policies\n- an assessment of the risks in the environment and the activities taking place\n there.\n As a first aider, you need to be aware of these requirements and how they affect\n you.\n Risk assessment\n A risk assessment is a systematic way of looking at the potential risks that may\n affect a place or activity. A risk assessment can be one of the following:\n- a process of identifying significant hazards and assessing risks at a specific\n workplace or event, such as a beauty salon or a school trip\n- a process of planning for any emergencies that might occur, for example on a\n\n First aid reference guide 7\n sports field.\nA risk assessment can look at many aspects of a workplace or event, including:\n- previous accidents, injuries or emergencies\n- special requirements for people with specific needs.\nBoth first aid cover and equipment must be determined from the risk assessment.\nSt John Ambulance provides an online tool that allows you to develop a plan to\nensure you have sufficient first aid cover.

Smaller companies might want to issue a printed copy of the\npolicy to individuals, while larger organisations may prefer to include it on a staff\nintranet site. However it is distributed, it is important that all staff are aware of the\ncontent of the policy and have access to it.\n## Content\nA written health and safety policy should be easy to understand and not open to\nmisinterpretation. There are no rules about how long it needs to be or how the\ninformation is presented. It must simply communicate:\n- the management's commitment to health and safety\n\n8 First aid reference guide\n- how health and safety is implemented and monitored in the working\n environment.\n The policy must state whose role and responsibility it is to ensure that health and\n safety standards and identified requirements are both checked and maintained.\n The policy should include:\n- the job title of the senior person in the organisation who is responsible for\n health and safety policies\n- the names of the health and safety policy adviser and any safety representatives\n- commitment to the basic requirements of the Health and Safety at Work etc\n Act 1974\n- commitment to the management's additional requirements under the Health\n and Safety Regulations\n- duties towards the wider public and others\n- the principal hazards in the organisation\n- specific policies of the organisation\n- specific targets for the immediate and long-term future.\n The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) provides comprehensive advice and a range\n of resources to enable organisations to produce a health and safety policy.\n The role of risk assessment\n The policy's objectives should address identified risks in an appropriate way,\n for instance by putting up a sign to highlight a trip hazard. The risk assessment\n determines the level of detail needed in the arrangements section.\n Don't confuse a health and safety policy with a risk assessment. The HSE website\n states:\n- policy: general vision and arrangements for the whole business\n- risk assessment: a regular review of how you remove or control hazards, and\n whether you are doing enough, or require further controls.\n A policy will only be effective if management and staff act on it, follow it through\n and review it on a regular basis.\n Source: hse.gov.uk\n Risk assessment can be a useful approach, particularly for an organisation with a\n number of sites where different activities are carried out. It allows you to tailor the\n organisation section of the policy to the individual managers at each site.\n Monitor\n Monitoring the policy to ensure it is both effective and relevant is crucial. This can\n\n First aid reference guide 9\nbe done in a number of ways, such as carrying out spot checks or safety inspections.\nMore formal monitoring can be achieved through audits and by reviewing\nmanagement reports and accident investigations.\n## Review\nJust as risk assessment is an ongoing process, so should the review of the health\nand safety policy. The policy and arrangements should be updated if:\n- a specific incident shows a weakness, failure or omission\n- a risk assessment identifies new risks that must be addressed.\nHealth and safety good practice\nThe acronym APR can help you remember health and safety good practise:\n- Assess: assess actions and the environment for risks\n- Perform: put measures in place based on the assessment\n- Review: routinely review the assessment.\nA lot of health and safety good practise information is available; visit hse.gov.uk to\nfind out more.\n## Equipment\nSpecialist equipment can help you perform first aid more effectively.

First aid kits must also be available for events and meetings, for\nexample at Brownie camp, at Saturday morning football or at the village Christmas\nconcert.

They can\n be found at sja.org.uk/first-aid-supplies\n As a first aider, you must regularly check your first aid kits to ensure that the\n contents are all in date and that used items are replaced. A full range of first aid kits\n and replacement supplies can be found at sja.org.uk/first-aid-supplies\n Health and safety equipment\n As a first aider, you might need to use health and safety equipment in an emergency,\n for instance, firefighting equipment to make an area safe before treating a casualty.\n Also, to ensure that a casualty gets the most effective treatment, you should be able\n to locate a first aid kit (and health and safety equipment) in public places.\n Signs and directions\n In public places and the workplace, there have to be clear signs showing:\n- where the first aid kit is\n- who the first aider is\n- who the fire marshal is\n- where the AED machine is\n- escape routes and assembly points\n- the location of fire alarms\n- the location of firefighting equipment.\n Evacuation equipment\n In tall buildings or where people with specific mobility issues work, equipment like\n an evacuation chair should be provided.\n Emergency evacuation plans\n Every workplace or public building must have an emergency evacuation plan.\n Everybody working at that site should know how the plan affects them. This should\n\n First aid reference guide 11\ninclude:\n- how the building or premises is evacuated\n- where to assemble\n- the procedure for calling the fire and rescue service.\nFirefighting equipment\nPublic places and workplaces must have firefighting equipment available. In an\nemergency, you might need to use this equipment to be able to evacuate a casualty\nsafely or to make an area safe. Only do this if you have received the necessary\ntraining and can do so without endangering yourself.\n## Reporting\nReporting is an important part of a first aider's role. It is always useful to keep a\nrecord of what happened to a casualty, for example:\n- where the incident took place\n- what you did to help the casualty\n- who else was involved or helped you\n- what advice you gave the casualty\n- whose care the casualty was passed to.\nSometimes records need to be formal, such as an accident report book at work.

The record of each incident should be kept for three years from the date of\nthe incident. The casualty's personal information must be protected.\nAn accident report book is required for all organisations employing more than 10\npeople but is a useful document for:\n- volunteer groups\n- for specific events, such as school trips for recording injuries to employees or\n visitors of a smaller organisation.\n\n12 First aid reference guide\n Anyone acting on behalf of the casualty can complete an accident report book. The\n first aider is normally the most appropriate person since they treated the casualty,\n though the injured person or someone acting on their behalf can also complete the\n accident report.\n RIDDOR reporting\n In the workplace, you must report certain incidents arising from accidents at work\n under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations\n (RIDDOR). This reporting must be done within specific times. Guidelines are set out\n on each page of the accident report book stating:\n- which injuries, diseases or incidents need to be reported\n- who to report them to and when.\n Notifiable diseases\n This guide gives details of when a disease must be reported to the local authority.\n This is done by a medical practitioner.\n Early years settings such as nurseries must inform Ofsted when there is an outbreak\n of any notifiable diseases in their setting.\n Keeping yourself informed\n Both first aid and health and safety are evolving subjects. All first aiders need to\n keep themselves informed about changes.\n The St John Ambulance website sja.org.uk provides useful first aid information. It\n also provides tools for you to use, such as a way to work out the first aid needs for\n your workplace.\n Regular training\n St John Ambulance recommends that you keep your skills and knowledge up to date\n by attending refresher and renewal training on a regular basis.\n This is because:\n- without regular use, skills and knowledge fade\n- first aid certificates must be kept in date for them to be valid (this is a legal\n requirement in some instances)\n- techniques, treatments, protocols and procedures change to keep up with\n medical developments and best practices.\n The HSE strongly recommends that a workplace first aider attends a skills refresher\n course annually.\n Online learning\n etraining.sja.org.uk\n\n First aid reference guide 13\nFirst aid calculator\nWe recommend regularly reviewing training needs so our free online requirements\ncalculator can quickly and easily assess your workplace requirements and let you\nknow what is the right option for you and your business.\nsja.org.uk/FA-calculator\nPersonal protection equipment\nYou should consider carrying these items with you at all times:\n- disposable non-latex gloves for first aid use: nitrile gloves (often purple or blue)\n are recommended\n- a face shield to cut the risk of infection when giving rescue breaths\n- alcohol gel for use before and after giving treatment.\n## Gloves\nPutting on disposable gloves\nOnly handle gloves by their cuff when putting them on.

Repeat with the\nother hand. Avoid contact with what was the outside surface at all times.\nDisposing of used gloves\nUsed gloves should be treated as clinical waste and put in a yellow (biohazard) bag.\nFace shield\nA plastic face shield can be used when giving rescue breaths to a child or an adult.\nOnce you have opened the airway, remove the shield from its packaging, being\ncareful not to touch the side that will come in contact with the casualty. Place it over\nthe casualty's face so the filter is over their mouth: a printed guide on the plastic\nwill help you position it correctly. Pinch the casualty's nose through the plastic, and\ndeliver rescue breaths through the filter with minimal interruption.\nAlcohol gel\nUse alcohol gel to wash your hands thoroughly the same way as using soap and\nwater. Pay particular attention to:\n- the palms and backs of both hands - use the palm of one hand to rub the back\n of the other\n- between your fingers - interlock your fingers to work the gel between them\n- the backs of your fingers - form a loose fist and rub the backs of your fingers\n against the palm of the other hand\n- your thumbs - rub the entire thumb by encasing it with your other hand\n\n14 First aid reference guide\n- your finger and thumb tips - rub them against the palm of the other hand.\n Hygiene\n Good hygiene reduces the risk of infections passing between a first aider and a\n casualty.\n Minimising the risk of cross infection\n- Wash your hands, before and after treating a casualty\n- Wear disposable non-latex gloves for first aid use: nitrile gloves are\n recommended. If gloves are not available, ask the casualty to dress their own\n wound, or enclose your hands in clean plastic bags\n- Cover cuts and grazes on your hands with waterproof dressings\n- If there are large quantities of body fluids, wear a plastic apron and plastic\n glasses to protect your eyes\n- Dispose of all waste safely. Soiled material should be placed in a yellow\n (biohazard) bag for incineration. Used needles should go in a sharps container.\n The emergency services may take the waste with them for proper disposal, and\n your local council should have facilities\n- Do not touch a wound with your bare hands\n- Do not touch any part of a dressing that will come in contact with a wound\n- Do not cough or sneeze over a casualty while you are treating them. In\n particular, avoid breathing, coughing or sneezing over an open wound.\n Hand washing\n Hand washing reduces the risk of infections passing between a first aider and a\n casualty\n Self-care\n Following a more serious first aid incident and depending on the outcome, some\n first aiders can experience a range of emotions. You may go through what happened\n again and again in your mind, so it may be useful to talk to someone else who\n may have been there at the incident or someone you know has been in a similar\n experience.\n This is especially important if the outcome was not what you hoped for. Even with\n the correct treatment and however hard you try on some occasions a casualty will\n not recover from the injuries or illness. If you are finding it hard to deal with what\n has happened you should seek support, if your workplace has a mental health first\n aider they may be able to help signpost you to appropriate support and maybe a\n good person to talk to, other options include your GP, a counsellor or any support\n mechanisms that your company may have in place.\n\n First aid reference guide 15\nAssessing a casualty\nWhen you encounter a casualty, you have to assess them so you can deliver\neffective, safe and prompt first aid. There are two procedures you must follow to\nhelp you determine what your response should be:\n- The first process is called the primary survey which is an initial assessment to\n identify and deal with life threatening injuries or conditions\n- This can be followed by the secondary survey which is a detailed and\n methodical examination of the casualty to look for injuries that may not be\n apparent.\nPrimary survey\nThe primary survey is often referred to as DRABC. DRABC stands for the five main\nparts of the primary survey and is a good way to remember the procedure:\n- Danger\n- Response\n- Airway\n- Breathing\n- Circulation.\nYou should apply DRABC to all first aid incidents, however small.\n## Danger\nBefore approaching any casualty, first, ensure that there is\nno danger to you.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 19103, "end_char_idx": 23738, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54502cab-f115-4174-9b23-2545c4544d54": {"__data__": {"id_": "54502cab-f115-4174-9b23-2545c4544d54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef416662-5c4f-4e4d-a64e-9d47b2c652c0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f2db8fb812d31f2a5429fc5d31448ecb4071fcd386825661d9cb9ae69fa5efe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "915ea284-4611-44d5-9020-7c6eaec72aa7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "86ae5f2a79027b8ca1b32315ab0f4c69a7551a21754560e613176e88a9b64dd5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a9ae052-f55c-467d-be4f-73eda36e2675", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7fb388b12c478bbc674911d47621ae5fcad27a3eeccdb0a2127994c34312e21b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "There are two procedures you must follow to\nhelp you determine what your response should be:\n- The first process is called the primary survey which is an initial assessment to\n identify and deal with life threatening injuries or conditions\n- This can be followed by the secondary survey which is a detailed and\n methodical examination of the casualty to look for injuries that may not be\n apparent.\nPrimary survey\nThe primary survey is often referred to as DRABC.

Kneel by the casualty. Place a hand on their forehead.\n Gently tilt their head back so their mouth opens (don't\n put your other hand under their neck)\n 2. Place your index and middle fingertips under the point of\n their chin. Lift and hold the chin to keep the airway open.\n If you suspect the casualty has a spinal injury, use the jaw-\n thrust technique (see page 70).\n Breathing\n Once you have opened the airway, check whether the casualty\n is breathing normally through their nose.\n 1. Place your cheek just above the casualty's mouth and nose\n 2. Listen, look and feel for breath (for no more than 10\n seconds). At the same time look down the casualty's\n chest for any movement.\n In the first few minutes after the heart has stopped it is\n common to see agonal breathing. This is short, infrequent gasps for breath and\n should not be mistaken for normal breathing.\n- If the casualty is not breathing normally, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n (CPR) immediately (see pages 23-28)\n- If the casualty is breathing normally, treat any life threatening injuries and\n place them in the recovery position (see pages 21-22). If their breathing\n becomes noisy, stop treatment and turn them into the recovery position before\n continuing.\n Circulation\n Injuries or conditions that result in severe bleeding can be life threatening because\n of the risk of shock. However, only check for circulation once you are sure that the\n casualty is breathing normally: do not waste any time performing CPR.\n\n First aid reference guide 17\nOxygen flow chart\nAssess the situation.

The procedure for this is called the\n secondary survey. It involves finding out the history, signs, symptoms and physically\n examining the casualty in a methodical way.\n History - what has happened.\n Signs - things you can see such as swelling, deformity, bleeding or any obvious\n injury.\n Symptoms - these are things the casualty will tell you such as they are feeling sick\n or their arm hurts.\n Some useful questions to ask are about\n A - Allergies (are they allergic to anything?)\n M - Medication (are they taking any drugs, prescribed or over the counter)\n P - Previous medical conditions (such as asthma, heart disease or diabetes)\n L - Last meal (what food or drink did they last have and when)\n E - Event history (what happened in the lead up to them needing help)\n Head-to-toe survey\n Tell the casualty what you are doing and why. Listen carefully to what they tell you.\n 1. Run your hands over the casualty's scalp looking for bleeding, swelling or\n indentations. Try not to move their head or neck\n 2. Look into each ear for blood, fluid or objects\n 3. Open their eyes and check their pupils for size and reaction to light. The pupils\n should be an equal and normal size and react equally\n 4. Check their nose for blood, fluid or objects\n 5. Check the rate and depth of their breathing. Note any unusual odour on their\n breath\n 6. Check their mouth for anything that may block their airway. Do not remove\n dentures unless they are loose. Check for wounds\n 7. Look at their face for wounds or irregularities to the natural lines\n 8. Note the colour and temperature of their skin.\n 9. Loosen clothing around their neck. Look for wounds or swelling to their neck\n tissues\n 10. Check for a medic-alert talisman, which is usually worn around the neck or\n wrist\n 11. Move your hands down their chest to check for swellings, irregularities or\n wounds. If the casualty is responsive, ask them to take a breath to assess the\n chest for equal movements and to listen for unusual lung sounds\n 12. Check their collar bones for deformities\n 13. Check each arm in turn for wounds or irregularities. If the casualty is\n responsive, ask them to bend and straighten their fingers and elbows if it\n\n First aid reference guide 19\n doesn't cause pain\n14. Check each hand and finger for injury\n15. If there is a problem with movement or loss of feeling in their arms, do not\n examine their spine. If there is not, place your hands under the hollow of their\n back to check for swelling, tenderness or irregularity\n16. Look at their abdomen for wounds or bruising, then place a hand on the\n casualty's abdomen. Press down gently, looking for tenderness or rigidity\n17. Note any signs of incontinence or bleeding from the genital or anal areas\n18. Examine each leg in turn for wounds and swelling.

CPR is an important part of the chain of\nsurvival for a casualty whose heart has stopped. The quality of CPR is dependent on\nthe correct depth and rate.\nChain of survival\n- Recognising cardiac arrest\n- Early request for help to the emergency services\n- Early basic life support - CPR\n- Early defibrillation\n- Early advanced life support.\n AMBULANCE\n Early access Early CPR Early defibrillation Early advanced\n care\nTo provide the last two links in the chain you need to get help as soon as possible.\nDefibrillation is known to greatly improve the outcome for some casualties whose\nhearts have stopped. If a defibrillator is available, get it when calling the emergency\nservices: a defibrillator should not be used on a baby.\nIn the first few minutes after the heart has stopped, it is common to see agonal\nbreathing - short, infrequent gasps for breath. If the casualty is not breathing\nnormally, perform CPR immediately.\nCasualties might not recover while you are performing CPR but your actions will\nhelp to keep them alive until the emergency services take over.\nChest compressions\nThe heart pumps blood around the body. When it stops you can do this manually by\nperforming chest compressions.\nThere is no need to remove the casualty's clothes to find the correct hand position\nwhen giving chest compressions.\n\n24 First aid reference guide\n Rescue breaths\n Rescue breaths are given to an unresponsive casualty who is not breathing normally\n increasing oxygen in their lungs and bloodstream, increasing their chances of\n survival.\n Rescue breaths should always be performed with chest compressions, and never by\n themselves.\n During a pandemic, compression-only-CPR may be recommended by the UK\n Resuscitation Council www.resus.org.uk\n If the chest does not rise:\n 1. Check that the casualty's head is in the correct position and that their airway is\n open\n 2. Check that you have a good seal around the casualty's mouth (mouth and nose\n for a baby)\n 3. Check that you are pinching the nose properly if the casualty is a child or adult\n 4. Check that there is no obstruction in the casualty's mouth.

The heart's muscles are\n stimulated by tiny electrical impulses generated by a network of specialised tissue.\n Cardiac arrest is when the heart stops beating. Not all causes of sudden cardiac\n arrest are known. One common cause is myocardial infarction (heart attack)\n which is when the heart's own arteries become blocked. Apart from not supplying\n the body with oxygenated blood, the heart muscle itself is starved of oxygen and\n becomes damaged so does not respond properly to the natural electrical signals:\n- The electrical impulses may no longer cause rhythmical pumping and the\n muscle contractions become uncoordinated\n- The muscle may quiver or tremble, due to chaotic impulses\n- The heart stops pumping.\n The unrhythmical and chaotic attempts to beat are called arrhythmia. There\n are several forms of arrhythmia, and not all of them are shockable with an AED.\n However, the most common type, which occurs in about 80% of cardiac arrests, is\n shockable. This is called ventricular fibrillation (VF). If treated quickly, VF may be\n converted back to a working rhythm.\n An AED should be applied to a casualty with a suspected heart attack who is\n unresponsive and not breathing normally.\n It is a good idea to familiarise yourself with the AED you are likely to use as this can\n save vital seconds in an emergency.\n Procedure\n This procedure is for children and adults: an AED should not be used on a baby. A\n child can be defibrillated if paediatric pads are available for the AED.\n When you arrive at the scene, quickly establish:\n- where the casualty is in the chain of survival\n- what, if any, emergency first aid has been administered.\n Using an AED\n 1.

If the casualty is unresponsive and not breathing normally prepare to use the\n AED. If possible, ensure someone is performing CPR as you do this. They should\n continue to perform CPR even as you attach the pads to the casualty's chest,\n only stopping when you reach step 8\n4. Position the AED beside the casualty, ideally to their left as this makes the pad\n placement easier and means you don't need to reach over the casualty. If you\n cannot position the AED on the casualty's left do not worry as its position does\n not affect its operation\n5. Remove medication patches and metal jewellery from the casualty but this\n should not delay the application of the AED\n6. Turn on the AED and follow the voice prompts\n7. Remove the electrode pads from their sealed packets. Place them on the\n casualty's bare chest following the instructions given with the pads.

Each pad has a clear visual instruction showing where to place it. One pad goes\n on the right side of the casualty's upper chest, directly under their collar bone.\n The other one is placed on the left side of the casualty's chest, about 10cm\n below their armpit. If the casualty has a pacemaker fitted, the pads must be\n placed 12-15cm from it. An implanted pacemaker appears as a bump under the\n skin.

The memory can then\n be cleared ready for the AED to be used again. You need to confirm how this is done\n in your organisation.\n An accident report and, if required, a defibrillation report need to be completed.\n Consider the emotions that you have experienced as a result of carrying out the\n procedure, whether or not the casualty has survived.

They are\ncaused by a disturbance in the brain's activity and some seizures can be violent. The\ncasualty may not be aware of what is happening or might be unresponsive. There\nare two main types: absence seizures and major seizures.\nRecognition (absence seizures)\nAn absence seizure is when the casualty loses general awareness for a few seconds.\nThis can go unnoticed by people around them. Sometimes unusual movements are\napparent, such as repeated swallowing or other gestures. Children who are thought\nto be accident-prone might in fact be suffering from absence seizures. People who\nknow that they experience seizures often wear a medic-alert talisman, usually\naround their neck or wrist.\n## Treatment\nAims - To protect and monitor the casualty until they are fully recovered.\n- There is no immediate treatment for this other than reassurance. Advise the\n casualty to get medical advice.\n- Be aware that an absence seizure may be followed by a major seizure.\nRecognition (seizures)\n- Sudden loss of response\n- Becoming rigid, arching their back\n- Breathing may become noisy and difficult\n- Convulsions begin (jerky movements)\n- Saliva from the mouth can be blood-stained if they have bitten their lips or\n tongue\n- Loss of bladder and bowel control.\n## Treatment\nAims - To protect and monitor the casualty and to get medical help.\n1. Clear space around the casualty and protect them by padding sharp or\n dangerous objects with coats or cushions. If possible, protect the casualty's\n head from the floor with a cushion or some other similar item\n2. Loosen tight clothing around the neck, chest and waist. Do not put anything into\n the casualty's mouth\n3. When the seizure stops, check the casualty's breathing:\n- If they are breathing normally, place them in the recovery position (see\n pages 21-22)\n\n34 First aid reference guide\n- If they are not breathing normally, be prepared to perform CPR (see pages\n 23-28). Do not attempt to force or keep their jaw open\n 4. Stay with the casualty. Monitor their breathing and level of response\n 5. Dial 999 or 112 for an ambulance if the casualty:\n- has continuous seizures\n- sustains an injury that requires urgent medical attention\n- has never had a seizure before\n- has a seizure that lasts for more than five minutes\n- is unresponsive for more than 10 minutes.\n Following the seizure the casualty will relax, their breathing will return to normal\n and they become responsive within a few minutes. They may be unaware of their\n surroundings and feel very tired. They can fall into a deep sleep.\n Febrile convulsions\n Both babies and children can have convulsions (seizures) between the ages of six\n months and five years caused by high body temperature. It does not mean they will\n have seizures throughout their life.\n Recognition\n- Vigorous shaking with an arched back\n- Possible vomiting\n- Loss of bowel or bladder control\n- Red, puffy face and neck\n- High temperature with hot, flushed skin and, perhaps, sweating.\n A high temperature (fever) is normally a sign of illness. However, a baby's\n temperature may also rise if they are teething.\n Treatment\n Aims - To protect and monitor the baby/child and to get medical help.\n 1. Let the convulsion happen naturally, but protect the baby/child from hurting\n themselves on hard or sharp objects:\n- If they are on the floor, try to protect their head with a cushion or similar\n item\n- Do not put anything into their mouth\n 2. Cool the baby/child by removing any bedding and clothes. You may only be able\n to do this once the seizure has stopped. Ensure a good supply of fresh air. Do\n not overcool\n 3.

It affects the air passages, which\n are the tubes that carry air into and away from the lungs. The air passages in\n someone with asthma are sensitive to particular irritants. These irritants, commonly\n known as triggers, include pollen, animal fur, feathers, exercise, smoke and house\n dust mites. Infection can make asthma worse, people with asthma may have more\n difficulty breathing at night.\n Once diagnosed with asthma, the person is given support to help them through\n their illness. This can include medication, breathing exercises and details of support\n groups.\n Medication is usually delivered by inhaler. There are two main types of inhalers:\n- Reliever inhalers (usually blue or with a blue cap) are used immediately to\n relieve symptoms\n- Preventer inhalers (often brown or with a brown cap) are used each day to help\n prevent asthma attacks, not for relief when an attack starts.\n Anyone with asthma may use a spacer fitted to their inhaler so they can breathe in\n the medication more effectively.\n\n First aid reference guide 41\nAll casualties\n## Recognition\n- Difficulty breathing and/or talking\n- Wheezing\n- Distress and anxiety\n- Coughing\n- Grey-blue skin (cyanosis)\n- May only be able to speak in one word or short sentences.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 65260, "end_char_idx": 69589, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5dbd912c-0776-4b30-9a02-ddd0caee334c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5dbd912c-0776-4b30-9a02-ddd0caee334c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef416662-5c4f-4e4d-a64e-9d47b2c652c0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f2db8fb812d31f2a5429fc5d31448ecb4071fcd386825661d9cb9ae69fa5efe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b441271-3fbe-4c74-b8e5-bafef6ac8209", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fd428b46c04f8420f08ede88179cef23162ff10866c2a4e6d064996a296e7317", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2ecffb89-3386-4c95-bbe3-712a35990fa9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "92909f912d4160e24d05b7579c060cfab2ff16eea78b2ee6330ed0fdb0bf61e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Once diagnosed with asthma, the person is given support to help them through\n their illness.

If you have been\n trained, do not be afraid to administer their auto-injector.\n Auto-injectors come in adult and child doses.\n Auto-injectors in schools\n Following a lengthy campaign and public consultation, an amendment was passed\n in parliament to the Human Medicines Regulations. This amendment allows schools\n from 1 October 2017 to purchase adrenaline auto-injectors without a prescription\n and keep these for emergency purposes. These should be stored and delivered in\n line with the \u2018Supporting pupils with medical conditions at school' guidance which\n requires appropriate training to be provided to staff expected to administer the\n auto-injectors.\n Pre-use checks\n Before using an auto-injector:\n- Have you correctly identified the casualty's condition as anaphylaxis?\n- Is the auto-injector in date?\n- Is it prescribed to the casualty?\n Basic rules\n- Never practise with a real auto-injector\n- Never remove the safety caps unless you are going to use the auto-injector\n- Never inject into veins, buttocks, hands or feet\n- Never put your fingers or hands near the needle end of the auto-injector\n- Never leave the casualty until the emergency services arrive\n- When an auto-injector is used, the casualty must always receive medical\n\n44 First aid reference guide\n treatment even if they appear to have made a full recovery.\n Using an auto-injector\n 1. Arm the auto-injector by taking it from the hard case and removing the safety\n cap\n 2. Help the casualty to administer the auto-injector into the middle of their outer\n thigh. Firmly push the tip against their outer thigh until it clicks (it can be\n delivered through clothing)\n 3. Hold in place for 3 seconds or as instructed on the autoinjector\n 4. Repeated doses can be given at 5 minute intervals if there is no improvement,\n symptoms return and the casualty carries a second auto-injector\n 5. Give any used auto-injectors to the emergency services as proof of\n administration.\n 6. Advise the casualty to get a new auto-injector as soon as possible.\n Hyperventilation\n Hyperventilation is unnaturally fast or deep breathing; normally caused by anxiety\n or emotional upset.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 72331, "end_char_idx": 76481, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ffdd2a5d-51e8-4ad0-9ce1-e8c78ad2a574": {"__data__": {"id_": "ffdd2a5d-51e8-4ad0-9ce1-e8c78ad2a574", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef416662-5c4f-4e4d-a64e-9d47b2c652c0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f2db8fb812d31f2a5429fc5d31448ecb4071fcd386825661d9cb9ae69fa5efe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ecffb89-3386-4c95-bbe3-712a35990fa9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "92909f912d4160e24d05b7579c060cfab2ff16eea78b2ee6330ed0fdb0bf61e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7aa92cf7-7743-4c10-8887-65ebc6775040", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a4e1537c2a9963bdba1b26cd9d52f14a3609b213b27cc321f8024c9c9262f2cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Arm the auto-injector by taking it from the hard case and removing the safety\n cap\n 2.

Be kind and reassure them\n 2. Take them somewhere quiet, if possible\n 3. Encourage them to seek medical advice\n Hyperventilation due to anxiety is rare in children, look for other possible causes.\n Be aware that serious illness can also cause rapid breathing and anxiety.\n\n First aid reference guide 45\nCirculation problems\nChest pains\nHeart attack\nA heart attack is often caused by the blood supply to the heart suddenly being\nblocked, usually by a clot. The main risk to the casualty is that they then experience\ncardiac arrest, which is when the heart stops beating.\n## Recognition\nA casualty may experience one or more of the following:\n- persistent, dull and heavy, vice-like pain in the centre of their chest. This pain\n may spread down their left arm and up their neck and jaw. The pain does not go\n away with rest and may even occur while they are at rest\n- abdominal pain or discomfort, like indigestion\n- breathlessness\n- ashen skin with a blueness to the lips\n- rapid pulse that may have an irregular rhythm and become weaker\n- feeling faint or giddy\n- an overwhelming feeling of terror\n- possible sudden and unexpected collapse.\nSome people will have very few symptoms, especially those with diabetes mellitus.\nTreatment (responsive casualty)\nAims - To keep the casualty at rest and to get medical help as quickly as possible.\n1. Dial 999 or 112 for an ambulance and tell the emergency services that you\n suspect a heart attack\n2. Make the casualty as comfortable as possible by putting them in a half sitting\n position. Make sure that their head and shoulders are supported. If possible,\n place a coat or a blanket under their knees for additional support.\n3. Encourage the casualty to rest\n4. If possible get the casualty to chew and swallow 300mg of aspirin (one full\n dose)\n5. If the casualty has medication for angina, encourage them to take it\n6. Monitor the casualty's breathing and level of response until the emergency\n services arrive. Be prepared to start CPR (see pages 23-38)\nTreatment (unresponsive casualty)\nAims - To maintain an open airway, resuscitate and defibrillate, if necessary, and get\nurgent medical help.\n1. Open the casualty's airway and check their breathing\n2. If they are breathing normally, place them in the recovery position (see pages\n 21-22)\n3. Dial 999 or 112 for an ambulance and tell the emergency services that you\n\n46 First aid reference guide\n suspect that the casualty is having a heart attack and they are unresponsive\n 4. Monitor the casualty's breathing and level of response until the ambulance\n services arrive. If the casualty is not breathing normally, perform CPR (see\n pages 23-38).\n Angina\n This condition has similar recognition features to a heart attack. However, an angina\n attack often starts as a result of exercise or exertion and normally goes away with\n rest.\n 1. Help the casualty to sit down\n 2. If they have angina medication, such as tablets or spray, help them to take it\n 3. If the pain is not relieved in five minutes advise them to take a second dose\n 4. If they are still in pain five minutes after their second dose call 999/112 for an\n ambulance\n 5.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 75705, "end_char_idx": 79887, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7aa92cf7-7743-4c10-8887-65ebc6775040": {"__data__": {"id_": "7aa92cf7-7743-4c10-8887-65ebc6775040", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef416662-5c4f-4e4d-a64e-9d47b2c652c0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f2db8fb812d31f2a5429fc5d31448ecb4071fcd386825661d9cb9ae69fa5efe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ffdd2a5d-51e8-4ad0-9ce1-e8c78ad2a574", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c61be9092f621db51bc8831082d2ee1a49c04da8347f5bda9b428e7c555a51ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dcae6327-fcf1-47ce-8c80-ff1f39842520", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b99c23e54da7c0a2eebb855047d1cc9e84b109d8f5d93eb4ab4d74655db303ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Monitor the casualty's breathing and level of response until the ambulance\n services arrive.

If they or you are concerned,\n seek medical advice\n Shock\n This life threatening condition occurs when the body cannot get blood to its vital\n organs, such as the brain and heart. It is usually caused by severe blood loss, but\n there are other causes.\n Shock requires immediate emergency treatment to prevent permanent organ\n damage and death. Shock can be made worse by fear and pain. If there is a risk of\n shock developing, reassure the casualty and make them comfortable; this may be\n enough to stop the casualty deteriorating.\n All casualties\n Recognition\n- Rapid pulse\n- Pale, cold, clammy skin Sweating.\n As shock develops:\n- grey-blue skin, especially inside the lips (cyanosis)\n- weakness and dizziness\n- nausea, and possibly vomiting\n- thirst\n- rapid, shallow breathing\n- weak pulse.\n Eventually, the casualty may become restless or aggressive and may yawn or gasp\n for air before becoming unresponsive.\n\n First aid reference guide 47\n## Treatment\nAims - To treat any obvious causes of shock, to improve blood supply to the brain\nand to get medical help.\n1. Treat any possible causes of shock first, like serious burns or bleeding (see\n pages 48-54)\n2. Lay the casualty down on a blanket. Constantly reassure them\n3. Raise and support their legs to improve blood supply. If the leg is bleeding\n and the casualty is comfortable you can raise both legs, if there is a suspected\n fracture to the pelvis, hip or either leg, both legs should stay down\n4. Dial 999 or 112 for an ambulance\n5. Loosen tight clothing at the neck, chest and waist\n6. Keep the casualty warm and reassure them. Do not let them eat or drink. If\n the casualty is obviously pregnant lean her to her left side to prevent the baby\n restricting blood flow back to the heart\n7. Monitor the casualty's breathing and level of response until the emergency\n services arrive. Be prepared to perform CPR (see pages 23-28).\n## Fainting\nFainting is usually a short-lived condition with the casualty making a quick and\nfull recovery. It is caused by the brain not receiving enough blood for a short time.\nThere are a number of different reasons this can happen, such as standing for a long\nperiod, lack of food or emotional stress.\nRecognition (all casualties)\n- A brief period of unresponsiveness causing the casualty to fall to the floor\n- Pale, cold, clammy skin.\nTreatment for a casualty feeling faint\nAims - To improve blood flow to the brain and to provide reassurance.\n1. Ask the casualty to lie down. Raise their legs\n2. If possible, open a door or window to provide fresh air\n3. As the casualty recovers, reassure them\n4. Allow them to sit up slowly. If they sit up too quickly, they may feel faint again.\n If they do feel faint, lay them down again and raise their legs.\nTreatment for a casualty who has fainted\nAims - To improve blood flow to the brain and to get medical help, if necessary.\n1. Raise the casualty's legs\n2. If they do not become responsive quickly:\n- reassess DRABC\n- place them in the recovery position if they are breathing\n- dial 999 or 112 for an ambulance.\n\n48 First aid reference guide\n If they show signs of becoming responsive, follow steps 2 to 4 for a casualty feeling\n faint (see above).\n Bleeding\n A break in the surface of the skin or body is known as a wound.

Wounds can be\n described as open or closed:\n- Open wounds are when the skin is broken; most commonly, they are cuts and\n grazes. Open wounds can be serious and involve severe bleeding\n- Closed wounds are when the skin is not broken and the most common one you\n will deal with is a bruise. There are some injuries, such as broken bones, where\n a bruise can be an indication of something more serious.\n Internal bleeding may happen as the result of an injury or because of a medical\n condition like a stomach ulcer bursting. You should always consider the risk of a\n casualty having internal bleeding, especially if they display the symptoms of shock\n without any obvious fluid loss.\n All bleeding must be taken seriously as uncontrolled severe bleeding can lead to\n shock, collapse and even death. Controlling the bleeding is always your priority.\n For details of the symptoms of shock and how to treat it, see page 46.\n Minor bleeding\n Treatment\n Aims - To clean the wound and reduce the risk of infection.\n 1. If it is dirty, clean the wound under running water or with an alcohol-free wipe.\n Pat the wound dry using sterile materials, like a gauze swab\n 2. Cover the wound completely with a sterile material, such as a gauze square or\n dressing\n 3. If possible, elevate and support the injured area above heart level\n 4. Clean the surrounding area, remove the wound covering and apply a sterile\n adhesive dressing to the wound\n 5. Advise the casualty to see their own doctor if there is a special risk of infection.\n Splinters\n Splinters from wood, glass, or metal can enter the skin and can carry a risk of\n infection. Splinters can be easily removed from the skin using tweezers. However,\n if the splinter is deep in the skin it can be difficult to remove and should be left in\n place. Advise the casualty to seek medical help.\n 1. Clean the area around the splinter carefully with warm water and soap.\n 2. Grasp the splinter with the tweezers as close to the skin as possible and draw it\n out in a straight line keeping it at the same angle as it goes into the skin.\n 3. Squeeze the wound carefully to encourage slight bleeding as this will help to\n remove any dirt.\n\n First aid reference guide 49\n4. Clean and dry the wound and cover with a dressing.\n5. If appropriate ask about tetanus immunisation\n## Tetanus\nTetanus is a dangerous infection, caused by bacterium that lives in soil. If it\nenters a wound it can multiply and release toxins. Tetanus can be prevented\nby immunization, normally given in childhood but may need to be repeated in\nadulthood.\nAsk the casualty about tetanus immunisation. Seek medical help if:\n- They have a dirty wound\n- They have not been immunised\n- They are unsure of the number or timing of immunisation.\n## Bruising\nBruising is the result of blood entering the skin or bleeding in the tissues under the\nskin. A bruise can appear moments or days after an injury and can be a sign of a\ndeep injury.\nElderly people or those taking some medications can bruise easily.\nAll casualties\n## Treatment\n1. Raise the injured limb and support it in a comfortable position\n2. Use a cold compress to cool the area. Apply it firmly and keep it in place for at\n least 20 minutes.\n## Nosebleed\nBleeding from the nose most commonly occurs when tiny blood vessels inside the\nnostrils are ruptured. A nosebleed can be serious if the casualty loses a lot of blood.\nIt may indicate a more serious head injury.\nAll casualties\n## Treatment\nAims - To control bleeding and maintain an open airway.\n1.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 82614, "end_char_idx": 86797, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4806e679-b224-498f-b0f1-de558c2a9e1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4806e679-b224-498f-b0f1-de558c2a9e1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef416662-5c4f-4e4d-a64e-9d47b2c652c0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f2db8fb812d31f2a5429fc5d31448ecb4071fcd386825661d9cb9ae69fa5efe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dcae6327-fcf1-47ce-8c80-ff1f39842520", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b99c23e54da7c0a2eebb855047d1cc9e84b109d8f5d93eb4ab4d74655db303ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9197cb3b-603e-45ff-909b-463cb802a969", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "62c445952bf5a6865fcb0c86e353eeb5c9623dc574066a5ad33cd8e120f8b4ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "## Bruising\nBruising is the result of blood entering the skin or bleeding in the tissues under the\nskin.

If the nosebleed is severe, or if it lasts longer than 30 minutes, arrange medical\n advice such as 111.\n\n50 First aid reference guide\n Hygiene\n There is a risk of cross infection when dealing with an open wound. Follow the\n hygiene guidance on page 14, and in particular:\n- Always wash your hands before and after treating any wound\n- If possible, wear disposable non-latex gloves for first aid use: nitrile gloves are\n recommended\n- Make sure that any open wounds you have are covered with a dressing or\n plaster\n- Try not to touch a wound or the surface of a dressing that will come in contact\n with a wound\n- Dispose of any waste properly.\n The casualty is at risk of tetanus if the wound has come into contact with the\n tetanus bacterium, which is carried in soil, dust and manure. If you suspect that this\n has happened, advise the casualty to check that their immunisation is up to date.\n Severe bleeding\n Treatment\n Aims - To control the bleeding, get medical help and treat for shock\n 1. Control the bleeding by applying direct pressure to the wound\n 2. Dial 999 or 112 for the emergency services\n 3. Apply an appropriate dressing firmly to control the bleeding and minimise\n the risk of infection. It should not be so tight that it restricts the casualty's\n circulation\n 4. Treat for shock by lying the casualty down with their feet raised. If possible, lay\n the casualty on a blanket or some other item to insulate them from the cold\n ground.\n 5. If blood comes through the dressing, remove the dressing and reapply direct\n pressure over the wound with a new dressing or pad to control the bleeding.\n 6. Secure the dressing with the bandage once the bleeding is controlled, tie the\n knot over the pad to help maintain pressure\n 7. It may be that the call handler instructs you how to improvise a tourniquet\n to control life-threatening bleeding if you are not trained or do not have a\n tourniquet in your first aid kit, using items such as a triangular bandage, belt or\n tie\n 8. Monitor the casualty's breathing and level of response while waiting for the\n emergency services to arrive.\n Foreign objects in a wound\n- Small pieces of debris in a wound should be carefully removed before it is\n treated. If they are left in place they can cause infection or prevent the wound\n from healing properly\n- Objects firmly embedded in a wound should be left in place to be removed\n\n First aid reference guide 51\n by medical experts. Trying to remove them can cause further damage and\n bleeding.\nTreatment for embedded objects\nAims - To control bleeding without causing further injury, to minimise the risk of\ninfection and to get medical help.\n1. Control the bleeding by applying pressure on either side of the object. Be careful\n not to push the object further into the wound. Do not try to remove the object\n2. Cover both the injury and object with sterile gauze. Pad around the object,\n then bandage the wound. Make sure there is no pressure on the object.

Each lung is protected by two membranes and if air or blood gets\nbetween them the resulting pressure on the lung can make it collapse.\nA collapsed lung can put pressure on the other lung and the heart:\n- The heart may not manage to refill with blood properly (tension pneumothorax)\n which leads to reduced blood circulation and shock\n- Pressure on the other lung leads to breathing difficulties.\nAll casualties\n## Recognition\n- Breathing difficulties, often painful, rapid, shallow and uneven breaths\n- Acute sense of alarm\n- Lack of oxygen reaching tissues (hypoxia)\n- Grey-blue skin (cyanosis)\n- Coughing up blood\n- Skin around the wound crackles\n- Blood bubbling from the wound\n- Sound of air entering through wound as casualty breathes in\n- Neck veins become prominent.\n## Treatment\nAims - To maintain breathing, treat shock and get medical help.\n1.

Maintain the casualty's position. Monitor the casualty's breathing and level of\n response until the emergency services arrive\n 5. If the casualty becomes unresponsive, perform DRABC and maintain an open\n airway. Place them in the recovery position on their injured side to minimise the\n pressure on their healthy lung.\n Catastrophic bleeding\n- A catastrophic bleed is extreme bleeding likely to cause death in minutes\n- Blood is pumping from the wound\n- The bleeding cannot be stopped or slowed with pressure\n- Blood is quickly soaking through bandage after bandage\n A severe bleed is likely to be slowed with pressure and usual bleeding treatments.\n A catastrophic bleed will not and may have a higher priority than the airway does to\n the speed it can threaten life.\n In these cases, you may need to stop the flow of blood using a Haemostatic\n dressing, tourniquet or improvise a tourniquet following the instruction of\n Ambulance control if you do not have a haemostatic dressing or tourniquet\n available.\n Injuries requiring such treatment are most likely following a gunshot, stabbing,\n power tool accident or serious road traffic incident.\n Haemostatic dressings\n A haemostatic dressing can be used on a catastrophic wound to the head, neck,\n chest or abdomen, there are some cautions but remember you will be on the phone\n with ambulance control so take their guidance.\n 1. Place the pad over the wound and hold it tightly in place for a minimum of 5\n minutes, in some instances the dressing may need to be packed tightly into the\n wound.\n 2. Secure the dressing in place with the bandage, this may be attached or may be\n separate. They often have Velcro strips to help you secure it tightly in place\n 3. Recheck the dressing and monitor the casualty until the ambulance arrives\n Amputation\n On occasions limbs, fingers, toes or ears can be partly or completely severed.\n In many cases, surgery can be used to reattach the part.

Depending on the\nsize and depth of the area burned, shock is likely to develop. There is also a high risk\nof infection. If toxic smoke, hot gases or corrosive chemicals have been inhaled, the\nairway is also at risk. Always get medical advice when a child or baby is burnt.\nAll casualties\n## Recognition\nBurns are classified according to the depths of damage to the skin. There are three\ndepth, superficial, partial thickness and full thickness. There may be one or more\ndepths with a single injury.\n- Superficial burn: affects only the outermost layer of skin. You would expect to\n see redness, swelling and tenderness.\n- Partial thickness burn: affects the epidermis (top layer) and dermis (middle\n layer) of skin. The skin becomes red and raw, blisters form due to fluid being\n released from the damaged tissue.\n- Full thickness burn: all layers of the skin are affected and there may be some\n damage to nerves, fat tissue, muscles and blood vessels.\n## Treatment\nAims - To cool the burn.\n1. Do not touch the burned area\n2. Leave in place any clothing stuck to the burn unless it is contaminated with\n chemicals\n3. Leave any blisters intact\n4. Hold the burn under cool or lukewarm running water for a minimum of 20\n minutes, or until the pain eases\n5. Remove any jewellery or other constrictions while cooling\n6. Cover with a clean plastic bag, kitchen film or a sterile dressing\n7. Seek medical help if they have:\n- full thickness burns of any size\n- partial thickness burns larger than 1% (an area the size of the casualty's\n palm and fingers)\n- superficial burns larger than 5% of the body surface\n- burns on the hands, face, feet or genitals\n- burns with a mixed pattern and/or depth or that extend all around a limb\n- all electrical and chemical burns\n- if the casualty is a child or is elderly (however small the burn appears).\n\n56 First aid reference guide\n Burns to the face and mouth (all casualties)\n Recognition\n- Breathing difficulty\n- Soot around the mouth and nose\n- Damaged skin around the mouth.\n When treating burns:\n- Do not remove anything that is sticking to the burn\n- Do not over cool the casualty as there is a risk of lowering their body\n temperature too much\n- Do not use lotions, ointments or creams\n- Do not use adhesive dressings\n- Do not break blisters.\n Hygiene\n Wear disposable gloves throughout, if possible, and dispose of any waste properly.\n Chemical burns\n If it is a chemical burn, cool the burn with cool or lukewarm running water until\n the ambulance arrives. Avoid splashing any contaminated water on yourself or the\n casualty and make sure the contaminated water will not become a danger. As you\n pour cold water over the burn, carefully remove any contaminated clothing. If the\n clothing is stuck to the skin, leave it in place and continue cooling while waiting for\n the ambulance.\n Chemical burns to the eye (all casualties)\n Recognition\n- Intense pain in the eye\n- Unable to open the eye\n- Redness, swelling and burning around the eye\n- Eye watering profusely.\n Treatment\n Aims - To flush any chemicals out of the eye and get medical help.\n 1. Ask the casualty to remove their contact lenses if they can\n 2. Irrigate the casualty's eye under cool or lukewarm running water for a minimum\n of 20 minutes.
